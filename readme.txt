Help stop American Consorship by putting a ribbon that says Stop Censorship on your WordPress site or network (just like the one on wordpress.org).

== Description ==
A black ribbon with the words "Stop Censorship" will be put on in the top right corner of your website, linking to the [American Censorship](http://americancensorship.org/) website. Look at the screenshots to see how the ribbon looks. Check out the [Help Stop SOPA/PIPA](http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/help-stop-sopa-pipa/) entry in the WordPress news too. Thank you for showing your support!

Note: As of version 1.0.2 the ribbon is only displayed to logged out users to avoid covering up links on the WP admin bar.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin zip archive.
2. Extract it in your `wp-content/plugins` folder or upload via admin panel.
3. Browse to your plugins section and active the plugin.

== Screenshots ==
1. Here's how the ribbon will appear on your website. Will link to the americancensorship.org site.
