Help stop American Consorship by putting a ribbon that says Stop Censorship on your WordPress site or network (just like the one on wordpress.org).

== Description ==
Updated link to go to the [Declaration of Internet Freedom](http://act.freepress.net/sign/internetdeclaration/).

A black ribbon with the words "Stop Censorship" will be put on in the top right corner of your website, linking to the [American Censorship](http://americancensorship.org/) website. Look at the screenshots to see how the ribbon looks. Check out the [Help Stop SOPA/PIPA](http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/help-stop-sopa-pipa/) entry in the WordPress news too.
